Welcome to the official documentation for the Cluster API Provider Hetzner (CAPH). If you are new to it, you can keep reading the Getting Started section, the Quickstart guide will walk you through your first cluster setup.

## What is the Cluster API Provider Hetzner

CAPH is a Kubernetes Cluster API provider that facilitates the deployment and management of self-managed Kubernetes clusters on Hetzner infrastructure. The provider supports both cloud and bare-metal instances for consistent, scalable, and production-ready cluster operations.

It is recommended that you have at least a basic understanding of Cluster API before getting started with CAPH. You can refer to the Cluster API Quick Start Guide from its [official documentation](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io).

## Compatibility with Cluster API and Kubernetes Versions

This provider's versions are compatible with the following versions of Cluster API:
