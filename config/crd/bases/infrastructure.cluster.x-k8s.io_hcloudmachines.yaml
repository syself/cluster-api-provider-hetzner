                  Type is the HCloud Machine Type for this machine. It defines the desired server type of

                  server-type list`) or on https://www.hetzner.com/cloud


                  The types follow this pattern: cxNV (shared, cheap), cpxNV (shared, performance), ccxNV
                  (dedicated), caxNV (ARM)
